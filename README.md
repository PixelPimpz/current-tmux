# Current 
### a simple plugin for TMUX that provides #{@current} and provides the the name of the currently open document if the pane is running a process with open douments like (neo)VIM. If no documents are open, it gets the name of the currentlyt running process and, if the tmux-nerd-font-window-name plugin is also present, an application icon in the nerd font you're using.
